# Reverse-in-C
A program that translates lines in user-defined input into an output that is in reverse order compared to input. Last line to first, second last to second, etc.

If the user does not give any input arguments:
- prompt> ./reverse
- In this case, the program will ask for input from the user, and as the user gives input, the program will reverse this input into the console.

If the user gives one input argument (an input file):
- prompt> ./reverse input.txt
- In this case, the program will read the lines of this file and print the lines in reverse order in the console.

If the user gives two input arguments (an input file and an output file):
- prompt> ./reverse input.txt output.txt
-  In this case, the program will write the content of the input file into the given output file in reverse order.


For more detailed information on how this program is implemented can be found in the code files.
